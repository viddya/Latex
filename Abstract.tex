Abstract : 
Range searching problems are common in computational geometry. Finding the number of points inside a polygon and its attributes find its application in areas that deal with processing geometrical data, such as computer graphics, computer vision, geographical information systems (GIS), motion planning, and CAD. In this paper we have investigated the efficient ways to perform a range-searching problem.The first approach is the traditional brute force search method. The second method uses a Quadtree data structure to find the points inside the regular polygon on the CPU. The third method investigates finding the points inside the polygon using the Quadtree on a GPU.
